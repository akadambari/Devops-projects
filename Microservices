Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development in which software is composed of small, independent services that communicate to each other. 
There are different ways microservices can communicate, but the two commonly used protocols are HTTP request/response over well-defined APIs, and lightweight asynchronous messaging.

The characteristics of a microservices architectureinclude the following:
• Componentization via services
• Organized around business capabilities
• Products not projects
• Smart endpoints and dumb pipes
• Decentralized governance
• Decentralized data management
• Infrastructure automation
• Design for failure
• Evolutionary design

These characteristics tell us how a microservices architecture is supposed to behave. To help achieve these characteristics, many development teams have adopted the twelve-factor app pattern methodology

The twelve factors are a set of best practices for building modern applications that are optimized for cloud computing. 

The twelve factors cover four key areas: deployment, scale, portability, and architecture
